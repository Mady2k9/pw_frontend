          Alakh Pandey, the visionary Founder and CEO of Physics Wallah (PW), is
          on a mission to democratize education in India. Born in Prayagraj,
          Uttar Pradesh, he embarked on this journey in 2020, alongside
          Co-Founder Prateek Maheshwari, with the goal of making high-quality
          education accessible to all students in Bharat. Alakh`s leadership has
          transformed PW from a single YouTube channel into a prominent
          educational platform. His commitment to democratizing education shines
          through as PW offers an extensive curriculum for JEE and NEET exams.
          Alakh`s heart remains in teaching, and he continually fosters
          innovation to achieve his mission of affordable education for all. His
          dedication and entrepreneurial spirit have garnered recognition,
          including being named in `Times 40 Under 40`` and receiving the
          `Teaching Excellence` award by Entrepreneur India. Alakh was also
          honoured as `Edtech CEO of the Year`` by BW Business World and featured
          on the cover of Forbes 2023 in their EdTech Special. Alakh Pandey`s
          philanthropic spirit extends to sponsoring the education of deserving
          students, which he does regularly through the PW Foundation. The
          foundation also supports the emotional well-being of students through
          the PRERNA Helpline and is contributing to the education of more than
          500-600 slum students in Prayagraj in partnership with the NGO `Ek
          Pehel`. He is also very committed to empowering the girl child by
          providing them access to quality education and opportunities to make a
          successful career

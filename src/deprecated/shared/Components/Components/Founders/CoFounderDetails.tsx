          driving force behind PW’s resounding success as India’s most
          profitable Unicorn. In partnership with Alakh Pandey (Founder & CEO,
          of PW), he co-founded PW in 2020 with a shared vision to democratize
          education at scale in India. Prateek boasts an impressive academic
          background, with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from

          tech-based companies, he brings a wealth of expertise and technical
          prowess to the education sector. Since the inception of Physics
          Wallah, Prateek has played a pivotal role in steering the organization
          strategically. Under his leadership, PW has scaled exponentially,
          changing the game for the EdTech sector in India. Prateek's keen
          business acumen led to strategic acquisitions and partnerships for PW
          with key brands, such as PrepOnline, iNeuron, and Xylem Learning,
          reinforcing PW's position as a leading platform for high-quality and
          affordable education. Prateek's philanthropic spirit extends beyond
          the boardroom. He is actively involved with NGOs like Kashi Utkarsh
          and Asha Deep Vidyashram, dedicated to ensuring that education is
          accessible to all.
